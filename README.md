# Data science hackathon done for ILB DATALAB recruiting process ([ILB DATALAB](https://datalab.institutlouisbachelier.org): Institut Louis Bachelier Datalab)

- The final version of the notebook I did is *eraymond-ilb_lab_test_technique2.ipynb*
- This work covers all data science topics : data unterstanding, cleaning, preprocessing and model design.
- This hackathon was the last round of the interview process and I eventually joined ILB for a 6 months intern as a data science consultant.
